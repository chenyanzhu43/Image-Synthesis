+ Project summary: 

Neural Style Transfer has demonstrated impressive results in instance-based image blending. The method is based on a parametric texture model defined by summary statistics on Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) responses and appears to have several advantages over patch-based synthesis. This project is based on the work of Leon A. Gatysâ€™ paper, [A Neural Algorithm of
Artistic Style](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf). We retrained different image network models with adjusted style layer weights and introduced a third component in loss function. Besides, we tried
another pretrained neural network ResNet50 to compare with VGG19. Our result showed a successful image synthesis.
